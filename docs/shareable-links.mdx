title: Shareable Links

<Info>Feature available in <a href="https://tableflow.com/pricing" target="_blank">TableFlow Cloud</a>.</Info>

Shareable links provide a hosted page with your TableFlow importer. These are useful when an app doesn't exist to embed the importer UI, often during internal use cases or larger onboarding projects. This options can also be helpful during development and testing.

To view the importer (and to share the link with a user), press the “Preview” button and view it in a new tab.
